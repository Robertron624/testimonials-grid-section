## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to properly use flexbox and grid to create a responsive layout. I also learned how to use the `:nth-child()` pseudo-class to style specific elements in a list without the need to create class for each element.


### Continued development

I want to continue to learn more about CSS Grid and Flexbox. I also want to learn more about responsive design and how to create a layout that works on all devices including mobile, tablet, and desktop. I also want to start developing projects that require APIs calls and data fetching.
